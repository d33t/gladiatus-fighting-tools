=Locale translation=
The locale files for the current version can be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/gladiatus-fighting-tools/downloads/list download section]. Download and extract the archive to any location on your computer. Within the archive you can find 3 files, which you can open with your prefered editor (e.g. notepad++) and than you can translate the entities inside them.
==Examples==
The _first file type_ has the form: *somefile.properties*. Every row in the content of this file has the structure *entity=translation value*

_Example_:
{{{my.entity=My translation text}}}

To translate the above row, you have to translate only the text on the right side (*My translation text*), you *should not* translate my.entity!

The _second file type_ has the form: *somefile.dtd*. Every row in the content of this file has the structure *<!ENTITY gft.something "Translation value">*

_Example_:
{{{<!ENTITY gft.something "My translation text">}}}

To translate the above row, you have to translate only *"My translation text"*, but nothing else.
