 # Drag and drop the above file to the mozilla firefox browser
 # Restart your browser
or
 # Start downloading the *gft-v`*`.xpi* file and then choose open with mozilla firefox.
 # Restart your browser

==Transfer GFT internal database to other computer/firefox profile==
The steps below are to apply for windows xp, among other operational systems should be similar
 # Open windows explorer and type in the adressbar (alternativ: start menu -> run) *%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\* or follow the instructions on [http://support.mozilla.com/bg/kb/Backing+up+your+information this page]
 # Open the <mozilla profile> folder
 # Copy gft.sqlite file
 # Repeat step one on the computer/firefox profile, where you want to move the database
 # Paste the file above
 # Restart your firefox browser

Note: <mozilla profile> is the firefox profile, where you have installed GFT (if you are not using more than one profile, than the profile is called xxxxxxxx.default, where xxxxxxxx represents random string of 8 characters)

==Locale translation==
The locale files for the current version can be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/gladiatus-fighting-tools/downloads/list download section]. Download and extract the archive to any location on your computer. Within the archive you can find 3 files, which you can open with your prefered editor (e.g. notepad++) and than you can translate the entities inside them.
===Examples===
The _first file type_ has the form: *somefile.properties*. Every row in the content of this file has the structure:
 * *entity=string*

_Example_:
{{{my.entity=Some useful text}}}

To translate the above row, you have to translate only the text on the right side (*Some useful text*), you *should not* translate my.entity!

The _second file type_ has the form: *somefile.dtd*. Every row in the content of this file has the structure: 
 * *<!ENTITY gft.something "string">*

_Example_:
{{{<!ENTITY gft.something "Some useful text">}}}

To translate the above row, you have to translate only *"Some useful text"*, but nothing else. Please do not remove the quotes or the locale will break the addon!
