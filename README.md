**The latest version offered on this site is DEPRECATED since a while and DOES NOT WORK with the latst gladiatus server versions ( > v1.7.0 ) !!! If somebody wants to continue this project, then please contact me or open a ticket.**

This will be the last version, which I release and I hope that gladiatus layout will no change in near future once again. I'm dropping the support for this addon, this means that I'll not implement any new features or fix existing bugs anymore. Sorry folks, I just don't have the time and the motivation for this anymore!
Thanks to all people, which have been supported this project over GFT's existence. If somebody wants to continue my work, so just contact me per email or write a message at [feedback page](http://code.google.com/p/gladiatus-fighting-tools/wiki/Questions).

## Note ##
  * Defend reports are not automatically parsed. You should open this reports in order to have complete and correct statistics.
  * On fresh install the database is empty, so don't expect the battles count to match in the first 24h.
  * As more you fight on the arena as better and accurate statistic you will become.
  * In order to initialize the addon for a new server, you have to logout then login or just navigate to the overview page of your player.
  * This addon is compatible with other gladiatus addons(e.g. gladiatus tools). You can use both at the same time!
  * I cannot answer your question here, so please make it at project page on google(link below)
